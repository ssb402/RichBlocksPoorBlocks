## Version history ##

- v1.2: Incorporated the "Quick map change" feature. If the user chooses a different map, but keeps the same address, then upon clicking "Search", only the map colors, infoboxes, and legend will change. The map will not re-center itself and re-zoom.
- v1.01: Edited the bottom of 'index.html' so that people looking to advertise or order custom maps know they can do so.
- v1.0: Initial commit.
